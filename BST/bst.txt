-for every node , keys in left side are smaller nd keys in right side are greater 
-all keys are typically considered as distinct 
-like linkedlist it is a linked data structure 

-implemented in c++, as map,set,multiset,multimap 

example /operation:

create an empty BST 
insert 20,15,30 

Most of the operation in bst is O(h);height of the BST 

balance BST -O(LOG N)
so we need balanced bst than O(n)
